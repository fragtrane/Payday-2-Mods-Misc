# All Safe Previews

## Overview

Allow all skins from all safes to be previewed from the Steam Inventory menu. Legendary skins can be previewed as well as skins from the Completely OVERKILL safe. Adds a prompt to choose the preview wear.

Will also disable weapon preview rotation as well as the breathing effect in previews.

## Known Issues

This mod modifies the tweak_data of the contents of safes. May mess with the visual loot table when opening safes. This has not been tested since safes don't drop anymore.
