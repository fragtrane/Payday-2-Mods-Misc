# Outfit Locked Bugfix

## Overview

Removes a redundant achievement check to prevent the \"Outfit Locked\" bug. Will also prevent achievement-related outfits from becoming locked when offline.

## Known Issues

If you reset your Steam achievements, outfits will not become re-locked. This is the vanilla behavior for the gloves corresponding to the outfit anyways.
